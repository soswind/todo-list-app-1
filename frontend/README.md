# Todo List App - Frontend

This is the frontend part of the Todo List application built with React. The frontend communicates with the backend API to manage todo items.

## Project Structure

- **public/index.html**: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the React application.
- **src/components/TodoList.tsx**: A functional component that renders a list of todo items and handles user interactions.
- **src/App.tsx**: The main App component that sets up routing and includes the TodoList component.
- **src/index.tsx**: The entry point for the React application, rendering the App component into the DOM.

## Getting Started

To get started with the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd todo-list-app/frontend
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```

The application will be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

## API Integration

The frontend communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on todo items. Ensure that the backend is running and accessible for the frontend to function correctly.
